    <b>Here you can read about  my current progress. I don't know if 
anyone will find this interesting, but it is useful to see progress.<br> 

    <p> I'm pretty new to Unity and i understand that ist's not easy to 
learn about game development, but i think i might be able to make a fun 
game XD. </p><p>
    </p><p> I wanted to at least try my hand at making a moving camera, 
even if my game uses a fixed camera i needed to follow the player so 
making a test camera that the player can move helped me learn about 
cameras in Unity :‑P.</p><p>
    </p><p> Unity has a bit of a hard time recognising controllers but 
when it works it's pretty cool, oit's still a bit hard to map inputs to a
 controller. Especially hard since the input names are so wierd (；一_一). </p><p>
    </p><p> I managed to make Unity do a "cel-shading" style of 
lightning by following a tutorial, but i found an addon that's pretty 
cool since apart from "cel-shading" it also adds outlines to objects. 
You can even change the outline's color ( ﾟヮﾟ). </p><p>
    </p><p> I'm trying to make a stationary camera that follows the 
player. It seems easy to do, the camera i have right now can be 
controlled by the player but i don't want players to control it yet i 
want the camera to follow the player around similar to some older games.
 Don't worry my game won't have "Tank" controls X_x. </p><p>
    </p><p> I found some cool textures from an old CD, they seem to be 
free to use and are pretty nice. Mostly grass,rust,metal and rocks but 
that's just what i need for my game. I need to search old CDs more, they
 might have some more cool stuff on them ＼(^o^)／. </p><p>
    <img src="blog_files/MH_MM_Metal01.jpg" alt="Pretty Cool Metal Image">
    </p><p> This is one of the most interesting textures i found on the 
CD, it's a metal texture but i think it can be repurpoused as a "dirty 
window" texture and most players wouldn't probably notice. It's blue 
tint certainly helps to make it look lika a window lol.
